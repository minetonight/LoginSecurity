# Spigot 1.9 fork of LoginSecurity
The #1 Login Plugin for Bukkit.

Original version: https://github.com/lenis0012/LoginSecurity 
and its successor: https://github.com/lenis0012/LoginSecurity-2

I use this dated version because it has file storage and it is easy to manage the passwords. 
There is also a language file that can translate the plugin to your server native language!
